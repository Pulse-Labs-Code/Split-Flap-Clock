# Split-Flap Clock

> Wi-Fi-enabled split-flap clock using ESP32, NTP time sync, and non-blocking stepper control with homing sequence and error handling.

A compact, fully automated split-flap clock powered by an ESP32.  
Keeps time with NTP, uses a non-blocking state machine for smooth flap movement, and features error codes for easy troubleshooting.  
Designed to work with a custom-built split-flap display mechanism.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Wi-Fi setup via captive portal** (WiFiManager)
- **Accurate time sync** from NTP servers
- **Non-blocking operation** using `millis()` ‚Äî no delays
- **Homing sequence** for hours and minutes flaps at startup
- **Reverse direction** support for hours mechanism
- **Error codes** displayed for:
  - `1` ‚Äì No Wi-Fi connection
  - `2` ‚Äì Captive portal setup failure (404)
  - `3` ‚Äì Minutes homing error
  - `4` ‚Äì Hours homing error

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Install Arduino IDE** (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. **Add ESP32 board support** via Boards Manager
3. **Install libraries** via Library Manager:
   - `WiFiManager`
   - `NTPClient`
   - `AccelStepper`
4. Clone or download this repository
5. Open `.ino` file in Arduino IDE
6. Select **ESP32 Dev Module** in Tools ‚Üí Board
7. Upload to your ESP32

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Startup**  
   - ESP32 boots and tries to connect to Wi-Fi  
   - If no Wi-Fi, captive portal opens for setup  
   - If setup fails, error code `2` is shown

2. **Homing**  
   - Each motor runs until its Hall sensor detects the "zero" flap position  
   - If sensor not detected within set time, error code `3` or `4` is shown

3. **Time Sync**  
   - ESP32 gets current time from NTP  
   - Motors move to correct hour and minute positions

4. **Normal Operation**  
   - Every minute: minutes motor moves one flap  
   - Every hour: hours motor moves one flap  
   - Fully non-blocking so no drift between time and position
