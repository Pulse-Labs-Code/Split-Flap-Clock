## üîß How It Works

1. **Startup & Homing**  
   - Both minutes and hours drums are homed using Hall effect sensors.
2. **NTP Time Sync**  
   - Time is fetched via WiFi and adjusted for the selected time zone.
3. **Precise Step Control**  
   - Minutes advance 1 flap every 60 seconds.
   - Hours advance 1 flap every 60 minutes.
4. **Error Handling**  
   - If a fault occurs, a specific error code is displayed on the flaps.
